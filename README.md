## Problem Domain:
We are a software development startup whose market is to provide on demand and predictive ordering of services for customers.  When a customer comes to a lounge, relaxing area in companies, businesses, campuses, or restaurants, we want to provide a service to them.  Ideally this is through a mobile app, and we can target specific services to customers based on what theyâ€™ve ordered previously, or specials in the area.

## Solution:
You are going to develop a system that satisfies this problem domain.  You will develop and architect a system to support ordering, predictive advertising, analyzing previous orders/habits.
